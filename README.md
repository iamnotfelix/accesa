# Project description

The app has three pages: users, leaderboard and quests. On the users page there are all the users listed and you can do CRUD operations. On the leaderboard, the users are listed in ascending order of their points. And on the quests page there are all the available quest listed. You can add, update and solve quests. The solving of the quests is pretty simple. In order to prove that someone has done a quest, that person needs to input a string that matches the key of the quest.  Also a user cannot make a quest with more points than his points.
